# Resource: intersight_iam_user
The Intersight account user.

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `api_keys`:(Array)(Computed)Current API keys of the user. API keys are used to programatically perform API calls.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `client_ip_address`:(string)(Computed)IP address from which the user last logged in to Intersight.
* `email`:(string)Email of the user. Users are added to Intersight using the email configured in the IdP.
* `first_name`:(string)(Computed)First name of the user. This field is populated from the IdP attributes received after authentication.
* `idp`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -A collection of references to the [iam.Idp](mo://iam.Idp) Managed Object.When this managed object is deleted, the referenced [iam.Idp](mo://iam.Idp) MO unsets its reference to this deleted MO.

* `last_login_time`:(string)(Computed)Last successful login time for user.
* `last_name`:(string)(Computed)Last name of the user. This field is populated from the IdP attributes received after authentication.
* `local_user_password`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed)A collection of references to the [iam.LocalUserPassword](mo://iam.LocalUserPassword) Managed Object.When this managed object is deleted, the referenced [iam.LocalUserPassword](mo://iam.LocalUserPassword) MO unsets its reference to this deleted MO.
